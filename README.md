# Ready Git Go - Learn Git Quick

## Background and Overview

Ready Git Go is a game about git. The game is meant to teach users the basic concepts and terminal commands to get started with git, inspired by similar games like [Flexbox Froggies](http://flexboxfroggy.com/) and [Grid Garden](http://cssgridgarden.com/).

Users will interact with a virtual terminal using the same commands as they would in an actual development environment. However, instead of using long complex filenames, users will refer to various animals.
